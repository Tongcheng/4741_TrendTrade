This is Project for class ORIE 4741 by Tongcheng Li. 

In this project, we want to identify relations between Google Trend data and Stock's daily price and volume.
Specifically, we are interested in the following problems:

Given Daily prices (including: open price, close price, daily high price, daily low price) and volume of 500 S&P500 stocks.
We want to find how information of Google Trends contribute to the formation of prices in the following ways:

(1) How does the Google Trend of stock abbreviated symbols (for example: AAPL for apple stock) indicate price change of the day, max price difference of the day and volume of the day.

(2) How does the Google Trend of stock abbreviated symbols (for example: AAPL for apple stock) plus some fundamental terminology (For example: debt, EPS (earning per share) etc.) contribute to a stock's price and volume.
